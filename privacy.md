# Bridge Translate — Privacy Policy

> Last updated: `2025-10-03`.

Bridge Translate runs entirely in the user’s browser and relies only on Chrome’s built-in APIs. No servers are contacted by the extension for translation or processing.

## Data Processing

- Input text selected or typed for translation is processed locally in the browser context;
- Preferences and optional local history are stored using `chrome.storage` on the user’s device;
- No data is sold, shared, or sent to external services.

## Permissions

- `storage`: store preferences and optional local history;
- `offscreen`: perform work without blocking the page UI;
- Host permissions (e.g., `<all_urls>`): enable the content script to detect editable fields. Browsing history is not collected.

## User Controls

- Clear local history and preferences in the popup at any time;
- Remove the extension from `chrome://extensions`.

## Children’s Privacy

This extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information.

## Changes

Updates to this policy will appear in this file and in the Chrome Web Store listing.
